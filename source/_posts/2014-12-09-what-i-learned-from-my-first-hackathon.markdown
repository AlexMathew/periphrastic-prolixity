I finally got to do something I've always wanted to. I took part in a hackathon.

The [Koding hackathon](http://koding.com/Hackathon) was a 48-hour online hackathon, which happened over the first weekend of December 2014 (not going for specific dates, because timezones). For me, it was a great choice for a first hackathon because it helped eliminate the biggest problem that stopped me from taking part in a hackathon so far - getting to the venue. This was in the middle of my holidays, and I could work from home. Everything felt right. I managed to complete my working web app, "[G33K](http://github.com/AlexMathew/g33k)", in the 48 hours (I did screw up big time, though). It was a great sense of accomplishment knowing that I had the most productive 48 hours I've had in a long time. And over that weekend, I learned a lot. 

Here's what I learned from my first hackathon.
<!--more-->

* **Get a team**

Do **NOT** go for a hackathon solo, no matter how good you are. It's always better to have people to share the load with. I didn't expect to get shortlisted to the hackathon, so I didn't talk to anyone about teaming up with them. Once I got the email from Koding that I was in, I scrambled to find a teammate. I asked a few of my friends, but none of them were free for the weekend, and that's when I decided to go solo for the hackathon. It was fun to try to take the whole thing alone, but after a while it gets to you. You need a team to share the work and to share the load of the pressure.

* **Find a comfortable position to work**

I could barely move my neck after the 48 hours, and I'm not even 21. This is more than just about a hackathon - this is something I should have in mind considering I may be working long hours very often. I need to find the most comfortable and physically ideal position for working, and incorporate it.

* **Maintain your todo list**

Lack of sleep is not an ideal situation to be in while working, but it's something you're forced into during a hackathon. So when you're sleep-deprived, it's not too easy to remember what you have to do or how you planned to do them. Have a notepad or use post-it notes to keep track of everything you need to get done. This is a great way to avoid forgetting to put in some feature that you originally planned to.

* **Be comfortable with your stack**

There are two ways you can decide a stack for your hack - use something you are familiar with, or experiment with something you've always wanted to try out. A hackathon is a great platform to learn new skills or to cement expertise in existing ones. But either way, it's good to have a basic working idea of everything you will be using, so you don't waste time learning from scratch during the hackathon.

* **Make sure you don't make noob mistakes**

Sleep deprivation does bad things to you. Very bad things. In a sudden moment of retardness, you could end up making stupid mistakes that you notice too late. There's not a lot you can do to "avoid" this - just hope you keep your sanity through the entire duration of the hackathon. 

* **Be sure about your deployment options**

The PaaS industry gives you so many options. [Heroku](http://heroku.com) is my personal favourite. You could also go for extremely popular options, like Google App Engine. But in some cases, you will have to improvise - case in point, the Koding Hackathon. The hackathon required participants to host their apps on Koding VMs. That meant I had to think about Apache or Nginx and all that stuff, in the last 2 hours of the hackathon. It was especially hard because I never had to worry about such stuff before. I managed to get it done (barely!), but it made me realize that it is necessary to have some basic knowledge about such sysadmin stuff. 

* **Get help as soon as possible**

During a hackathon, you definitely do not have time to stay stuck on a problem for too long. Get help as soon as possible. Ask people around, check StackOverflow or other answers pages and check the docs/FAQs again. If it's a problem with a particular service, message their support team or send them a tweet. Good services have an active service/support team that will respond immediately. Get your problem sorted out quickly and get back to work !

Getting through till the second round of judging is a really huge achievement, given how much I had to scramble to put this together. I know where I messed up, so I know quite well what I have to fix. I plan to continue working on G33K - fix up my mistakes, add new features and deploy it. 

I learned a lot from this hackathon, and it also gave me an awesome side-project to work on.
