    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And so, the journey with TNT begins. A 175K+ row dataset. A new challenge.</p>

<p>Over the next few posts, I&rsquo;ll document the various facets of my approach to this problem. Part 1 - how do I get started ?</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I registered for the event a few days after I heard about it. I thought I&rsquo;d give myself time to get some basic idea in place before I get started. So I took my time to read about various statistics that people proposed and how it&rsquo;d help in finding the most efficient players. In my head, it felt like Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill discussing Sabermetrics. I loved how people were crunching numbers to produce evidence of how the statistic they proposed was effective. It seemed simple enough - work with their averages and strike rates and other basic statistics. With the expected basic idea in place, I registered for TNT, and later that day, I got the link to the dataset. Downloaded the file, unzipped it and opened the Excel sheet. And then the bomb dropped.</p>

<p>Ball-by-ball data.</p>

<p>Somehow, I didn&rsquo;t expect that I would have to work with ball-by-ball data. In its native form, ball-by-ball stats are pretty useless (unless you&rsquo;re analyzing run rate patterns and everything). So before getting to work with various performance measures, I had to put the available data together into cummulative stats.</p>

<p>I had a CSV file to work with. I had to pick my weapon to get started. I had a few options.</p>

<p>Option 1 - R. I&rsquo;d always wanted to get started with learning R. I never found a compelling reason to get around to working with it. This seemed like a very good starting point. But I didn&rsquo;t want to learn something from scratch for this. I thought it&rsquo;d be a low-efficiency move to tread into unfamiliar territory, just to work with this dataset. So R, maybe later. Ruled out for now.</p>

<p>Option 2 - Pandas. Familiarity with Python, check. An interest to work with the data side of Python, check. But Pandas is very vast. Getting a base with NumPy to just get started is very hard. So SciPy stack, sometime soon, but not now. Ruled out for now.</p>

<p>I had a large dataset that I had to break into cummulative stats of each player. And I needed somewhere to store it. I would use a database anyway, so why not use it to also aggregate the data the way I need it ? And that was option 3.</p>

<p>Option 3 - MongoDB. I had done some basic work with MongoDB. The M101P course (which, even after 3 attempts, I haven&rsquo;t been able to finish) gave me a decent base with the CRUD and aggregation operations. 175K row dataset - bring out the aggregation framework !</p>

<p>Importing the data into a DB was easier than I thought.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ mongoimport --db tnt --collection odi --type csv --file ODI.csv --headerline </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that was done. Easy stuff.</p>

<p>The hard part was writing aggregation commands to do the required grouping. It&rsquo;s sort of like writing regular expressions - extremely hard, very annoying, but so damn powerful. After a lot of reference from the MongoDB docs and StackOverflow, I managed to get the stats I needed. For example, to get the total runs that a batsman scored.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>MongoDB aggregation to find total runs scored</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">odi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">aggregate</span><span class="p">([{</span> <span class="nx">$group</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">_id</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$Batsman&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Runs</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">$sum</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;$Runs Batsman&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">$sort</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Runs&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">}])</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>Some easy ones and some hard. And I managed to get the stats I needed.</p>

<p>Now, step 2. I need to put this together and build some performance measures.</p>

<p>Part 2 of this series will be up when I have some significant progress on that front.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(Yes, I just made an AC/DC reference)</p>

<p>First off, huge shout out to LatentView Analytics. Thank you for the job placement offer ! It&rsquo;s given me so much peace of mind, and in turn, freedom to experiment with new stuff.</p>

<p>About a week back, I heard about LatentView&rsquo;s new event for final and pre-final years - &ldquo;The Number Thing&rdquo;. Or, TNT. Perfect experimentation ground.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>All the problems were interesting. It was just a matter of picking the right one.</p>

<p>Cricket stat analysis.
Crime pattern analysis.
Text analysis.</p>

<p>One sports analytics question, and I was sold. That was my choice. Cricket Craze.</p>

<p>I knew it would be a lot of fun. I also expected it to be challenging. What I didn&rsquo;t expect was a 175373-row dataset. I knew this would be a whole new challenge for me. This was the biggest dataset I&rsquo;ve had to work with so far. I had to get new tools in my arsenal to tackle this. This was going to be a crazy ride.</p>

<p>I decided to blog about what my approach to this problem. Think of it as documentation. Over the next few posts, I&rsquo;ll break down my approach - from the initial steps, all the way down to the final result (hopefully!).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this and think there&rsquo;s a better way than the approach I&rsquo;ve taken, do give your suggestions ! Also, suggest resources to get started with them. You can write to me at alexmathew003[at]gmail[dot]com</p>

<p>Check out the &ldquo;TNT&rdquo; category on the blog to read the posts. I&rsquo;ll make regular updates as I make progress.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the beginning, there was nothing. And then I said &ldquo;Let there be a blog&rdquo;. And it was done.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do this. Laziness always stopped me. But I&rsquo;m not going to let it stop me anymore. I&rsquo;ve made the decision now. I am going to maintain this blog.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have any particular agenda of what I&rsquo;m going to put in here. Just my thoughts/opinions/reviews of stuff, a live blog of anything I&rsquo;m working on. Just to give some direction to my ideas. I&rsquo;m not going to try to make this huge and viral. I&rsquo;ll just let this lie in a corner of the vast expanse of the Internet, so I can look at it some day and recollect how I went about stuff (or say &ldquo;what was I thinking ?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Let the ride begin. And may the blog be forever in your favour.</p>
